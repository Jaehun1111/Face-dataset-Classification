# Face-dataset-Classification

This is Face dataset Classification project which is using scikit learn library with Python. face set is 'The Olivetti faces datase', and I used LogisticRegression. In python scikit learn library, there are many kinds of the way of learning, and each contains many parameters. I choosed the way of learning, and adjust some parameters to get high accurancy.

Up-to-date : This project will not have update, so there is no update breakdown.

Software : I used Python. And jupyter notebook, scikit learn.



here are download guide pages
Python : https://www.python.org/downloads/

jupyter notebook : https://jupyter.org/install

scikit learn : https://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html

This project contains very simple codes. So Python, jupyter notebook, scikit learn versions maybe don't matter. Just I recommand you to download latest version. But not Must.
I made this project with this version. Python: 3.9.2 Jupyter notebook: 6.2.0 (Jupyter core: 4.7.1) sklearn: 1.0.1 (pip: 20.2.3 numpy: 1.20.3, matplotlib: 3.4.2)

_In fact, It's assignment as you can see lol_

This is screenshot of project. This prohect contains codes, including parameter figures and accurancy. It's so simple!

Thankyou :)
